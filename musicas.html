            <h2>State Lines - Novo Amor</h2>
            Here, I'll forgive my thoughts now<br>
            Steer it, ‘cause I forget the dots now<br>
            <br>
            Was it all any more faded after all?<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            <br>
            Are you sure, did you call?<br>
            Did we ever really talk?<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            <br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't<br>
            <br>
            Dear, I wouldn't bet your heart down<br>
            Clear, but I couldn't get my head around<br>
            <br>
            Was it all any more faded after all?<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            <br>
            Are you sure, did you call?<br>
            Did we ever really talk?<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            I don't know<br>
            <br>
            I've been awake in every state line<br>
            Dying to make it last us a lifetime<br>
            <br>
            Trying to shake that it's all on an incline<br>
            Find me a way<br>
            I'll be yours in a landslide!<br>

            <h2>Little Freak - Harry Styles</h2>
            <p>Little freak, you Jezebel
                You sit high atop of the kitchen counter<br>
                Stay green a little while<br>
                You bring blue lights to dreams<br>
                Starry haze, crystal ball<br>
                Somehow you've become some paranoia<br>
                A wet dream, just dangling<br>
                But your gift is wasted on me<br>
                <br>
                I was thinking about who you are<br>
                Your delicate point of view<br>
                I was thinking about you<br>
                I'm not worried about where you are<br>
                Or who you'll go home to<br>
                I'm just thinking about you
                Just thinking about you<br>
                <br>
                Did you dress up for Halloween?<br>
                I spilled beer on your friend, I'm not sorry<br>
                A golf swing and a trampoline<br>
                Maybe we'll do this again<br>
                Tracksuit and a ponytail<br>
                You hide the body all that yoga gave you<br>
                Red wine and a ginger ale<br>
                But you would make fun of me for sure<br>
                <br>
                I was thinking about who you are<br>
                Your delicate point of view<br>
                I was thinking about you<br>
                I'm not worried about where you are<br>
                Or who you'll go home to<br>
                I'm just thinking about you<br>
                <br>
                I disrespected you<br>
                I jumped in feet first<br>
                And I landed too hard<br>
                A broken ankle, karma rules<br>
                You never saw my birthmark<br>
                <br>
                I was thinking about who you are<br>
                Your delicate point of view<br>
                I was thinking about you<br>
                I'm not worried about where you are<br>

          <h2>Next To You - Chris Brown (feat. Justin Bieber)</h2>
          <p>You've got that smile<br>
            That only heaven can make<br>
            I pray to God everyday<br>
            That you keep that smile, yeah<br>
            <br>
            You are my dream<br>
            There's not a thing I won't do<br>
            I'll give my life up for you<br>
            'Cause you are my dream<br>
            <br>
            And baby, everything that I have is yours<br>
            You will never go cold or hungry<br>
            I'll be there when you're insecure<br>
            Let you know that you're always lovely, girl<br>
            'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now<br>
            <br>
            One day when the sky is falling<br>
            I'll be standing right next to you<br>

            Nothing will ever come between us<br>
            'Cause I'll be standing right next to you<br>
            Right next to you<br>
            <br>
            If you had my child<br>
            You would make my life complete<br>
            Just to have your eyes on a little me<br>
            That'd be mine forever<br>
            
            And baby, everything that I have is yours<br>
            You will never go cold or hungry<br>

            Me and you<br>
            And I have no fear<br>
            I know we'll make it through<br>
            <br>
            One day when the sky is falling<br>
            I'll be standing right next to you, oh, oh, oh<br>
            <br>
            One day when the sky is falling (when the sky is falling, falling, oh)<br>
            I'll be standing right next to you (right next to you, oh)<br>
            Right next to you (right next to you, oh)<br>
